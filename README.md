A directions app for UC Berkeley's transit system, including Bear Transit and the Night Safety Shuttle. 

The heart of this application is a database containing information about each time a bus
operated by Bear Transit or the Night Safety Shuttle stops somewhere. Finding a
path between two points involves creating a graph data structure from this
database and using Breadth-First Search.
